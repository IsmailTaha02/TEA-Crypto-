# Image Encryption and Decryption

This project provides a Python script for encrypting and decrypting images using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA). It supports two modes of encryption: Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).

## Features

Supports encryption and decryption of images using TEA algorithm.

Provides options for both ECB and CBC modes of operation.

Offers visualization and saving of encrypted and decrypted images.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

## Usage
Place the image you want to encrypt in the project directory.

Run the script TEA.py.

Follow the prompts to select the encryption/decryption mode and provide the necessary inputs.

## Examples

### Encrypting an Image:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the TEA.py file.

Run the script using the following command:

python TEA.py

Choose option 1 for ECB encryption when prompted.

Follow the prompts to select the image you want to encrypt.

### Encrypting an Image with CBC mode:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the TEA.py file.

Run the script using the following command:

python TEA.py

Choose option 2 for CBC encryption when prompted.

Follow the prompts to select the image you want to encrypt.
